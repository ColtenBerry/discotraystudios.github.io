This week, Jonathon, Ian, and I have been attending the [Play Make Learn 2022](https://web.cvent.com/event/f0d9395e-fb6a-427c-9fb1-bf2b72d48d5d/summary) conference in Madison, WI, learning all about educational games, and sharing our community partner framework through Disco Tray Studios with others. It has been wonderful to connect and learn new techniques and structures to help guide our work! Here are the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e8L7Wu2K2NxfLXMIEsoktWkeH8VdOKorb0PnIFxQ5i8/edit?usp=sharing) from our presentation.
