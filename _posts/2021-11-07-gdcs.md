[ChemSim](https://discotraystudios.itch.io/chemsim) is a game meant for the practice of which reactions have which delta enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy values. 
This is a game currently at a pause in development due to lack of communication from the client.

This game is being developed for Dr. Caitlin Scott, a chemistry professor at Hendrix College.
