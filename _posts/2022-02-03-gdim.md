[@itsmaya](https://discotraystudios.itch.io/itsmaya) is a visual novel game where you follow the life of a Black girl named Maya as many different people as she goes through the American school system.
How many people can affect one girl's life as she grows up in the American education system?
Step into the shoes of influences and role models who must make decisions every day that will affect those around them.
Enact policies on the government level to help support those making a change on a personal level.
But there's just not enough resources for everything to work out in the end.

This game was developed for Dr. Veselka-Bush, a socialogy professor at Hendrix College.
