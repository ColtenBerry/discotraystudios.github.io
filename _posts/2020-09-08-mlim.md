Earlier this summer, we found the My Life
in Month charts posted by [Isabella Benabaye](https://github.com/isabellabenabaye/life-chart)
and [Sharla Gelfand](https://github.com/sharlagelfand/mylifeinmonths) very
intriguing, because in addition to being a convenient way to share a visual
history of your life with friends and family, these charts can help you focus
on the bigger picture and context of you life events.

We wanted to expand the appeal of My Life in Months beyond R programmers,
so we ported the idea to JavaScript, using d3 waffle charts as the basis for
visualization, and wrapped it up in a website where anyone can make their own chart.
This is our first project working together, and its helped us gain a lot of web
development and Github skills. We'd love to have your feedback
for improvement, thank you!

We added a new feature! Read about it [here](https://discotraystudios.github.io/2020/09/29/dates-mlim.html)
