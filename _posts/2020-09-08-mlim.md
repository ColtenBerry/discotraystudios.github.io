<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/isabellabenabaye/life-chart">Isabella Benabaye</a>,
  <a href="https://github.com/sharlagelfand/mylifeinmonths">Sharla Gelfand</a>, and
  <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html">Tim Urban</a>,
  <strong>My Life in Months</strong> is a
  chart that helps you see the larger picture of your life.
</p>
<p>Each square represents
  one month, and each row displays one year, with the upper-left corner being the
  month you were born.
