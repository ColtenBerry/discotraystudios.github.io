[Astronomical Bodies](https://discotraystudios.itch.io/astronomical-bodies) is a physics simulation game that was developed as a final project in Dr. Goadrich's Game Dev class by the request of Dr. Ann Wright.
Disco Tray Studios was then tasked with polishing up Astronomical Bodies.
So, experiment with different bodies with different masses in different locations.
Have planets crash into each other, create new solar system with only your favorite planets, or just chill to the music.
The solar system is yours to control.
Enjoy this 2D physics simulation project!

This game was developed for Dr. Ann M. Wright, a physics professor at Hendrix College.
