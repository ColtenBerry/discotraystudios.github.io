Earlier this month, we updated our first project My Life in Months to include an option for the user to create their chart with dates instead of months. The user inputs the starting and ending dates, and the number of months is calculated and the chart is updated accordingly. We felt this implemtation would be easier on users if they didn't want to calculate exactly how many months something was. We added a toggle button so the user could switch back and forth between numbers of months and the dates.
