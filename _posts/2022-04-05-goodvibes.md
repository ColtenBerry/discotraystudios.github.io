["Good Vibes"](https://discotraystudios.github.io/good-vibes/) is an app in which users can input their mood throughout the day,
track their mood history, and see the mood of the last fifty users.
When a user enters their daily mood, they occasionally receive an inspirational quote to motivate them. Once you have a "Good Vibe",
you can favorite and anonymously share it with other users.
The app also contains other helpful well-being resources.
Get your own randomly generated avatar, start logging your mood, and collect and share "Good Vibes" today!
