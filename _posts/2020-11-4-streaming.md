To help prepare for Dr. Goadrich's Game Development course in the spring, we created a Twitch account to stream educational games. We're streaming every day of the week, besides Wednesday, and each day is a different member of the team! We are hoping that the students taking Game Development next semester can watch our streams for inspiration for the games that they will design. Dr. Goadrich is also planning on us doing a game development workshop soon.
